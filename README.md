# UFOs

## Overview 
In this project, we took a data file of UFO sightings and created a table stored as a JavaScript array. In order to provide users with a more in-depth analysis, we wanted to have the ability to filter data based on multiple criteria. This project consisted of adding four additional filters to our table and webpage. 

## Results 
With the updated JavaScript and html code, users are now able to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and/or shape. When you first load the page, all UFO sightings will be present. To filter your search, you can type information in one or multiple categories.

For example, I want to look at all of the UFO sightings in Wisconsin. I am not concerned with any other information except ensuring the sightings are in WI, so I will enter wi under state. This pulls up all sightings documented in Wisconsin.

I can also search with multiple filters such as wanting to see all sightings in the US, specifically CA that were seen with a triangle shape. Entering these three filters resulted in the below:

## Summary 
Users now have multiple ways to search and filter through all the sightings to find what interests them most. 

### Drawback
One drawback of the new design of this webpage is users may think that they need to enter information in every filter search as it is not clear you can search by only one option or that if you do not enter any information, it shows all sightings. 

### Recommendations 
One recommendation would be to see what all of the options are under certain filters like the shape. One of the options for shape is 'light' which a user might not think to put into the search. There are also numerous states without any sightings. Having the ability to know what your specific filter options are under a category might help to drill down the data. 

Lastly, I would recommend that not only can you filter your search results but that you could also sort or order these by certain columns. For instance, if you are adding multiple filters in, perhaps you want to sort by state, shape or even by duration.
